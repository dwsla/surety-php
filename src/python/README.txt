This directory contains a sample Python program demonstrating the use of 
the AbsoluteProof REST API. You will need to edit "main" in simple.py to use 
your AbsoluteProof credentials. 

This sample accesses the AbsoluteProof test server by default. To use with 
the AbsoluteProof production server, you will need to edit "main" in simple.py 
and uncomment the production server baseURI.

For usage help type "python simple.py".

For help with the AbsoluteProof REST API contact Surety support at
